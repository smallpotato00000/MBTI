    <h1>MBTI types</h1>
   <p>Once the four basic personality designations are completed, the person is then assigned into one of the 16 personalities, based upon the combination of their personality designations.

However, each of the 16 personalities is more than just the sum of the four designations. The four-letter type formula is shorthand for the interaction of the four designations and which ones a person prefers to use first. The MBTI calls this “type dynamics.”</p>
